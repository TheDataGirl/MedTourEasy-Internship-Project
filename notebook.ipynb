This patient may have sepsis\n<p>Sepsis is a deadly syndrome where a patient has a severe infection that causes organ failure. The sooner septic patients are treated, the more likely they are to survive, but sepsis can be challenging to recognize.

However, before we develop predictive algorithms, we need a reliable method to determine patients who are septic.
